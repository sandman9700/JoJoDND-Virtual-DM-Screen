    Key Rule Changes</h2>

  <div id="Rules" class="content">
    <p>
      - <b>Humans</b> do not get any special racial features or bonuses. Check the <a href="https://www.jojodnd.com/races?focus=Human">Races page</a> for more information.
  </p>
  <p>
      - <b>Supernatural Checks</b> will be used to help you determine unexplained phenomena. 
      A successful Supernatural Check will reveal if an item has been infused with a special energy, or if it is just a trick that can be explained through conventional technology.
      For example, if you were to see a floating toaster, a successful Supernatural Check could reveal that it is floating because there are probably magnets inside,
      or it might clue you that something else is going on.
      <u>As a Reaction</u>, when you are affected/damaged by an unknown phenomenon that you suspect is an Ability,
      you may make an Supernatural Check in order to determine the function of the Ability.  
  </p>
  <p>
      - <b>Initiative</b> is calculated by adding your <u>Dexterity AND Wisdom</u>
      instead of just Dex. Stand stats can not be used to calculate initiative.
  </p>
  <p>
      - <b>Talking</b> is a free action. This module is based on JoJo's Bizarre Adventure after all,
      and it wouldn't be JoJo's without a side character commenting on everything happening, as it happens, even if the talking takes more than 6 seconds.
  </p>
  <p>
      - <b>The Tile System</b> is meter-based. Each 'square' represents 1 meter (3 feet).
  </p>
  <p>
      - <b>The Maximum Level</b> in this module is not necessarily twenty. There are certain characters and enemies that may be more powerful than the normal
      5e Level cap, but allowing this is up to the DM's discretion.
  </p>
  <p>
      - <b>Bonus Feats</b> are granted to make characters more powerful and interesting. You may select an amount of additional <a href="/feats">Feats</a> equal to your Proficiency Bonus.
  </p>
  <p>
      - <b>Bonus Proficiencies</b> are granted based on a character's Intelligence Modifier.
      You may pick that number of Skills (minimum of zero) and gain Proficiency in them.
      You may also swap some or all of these Bonus Proficiencies for Human Languages, Instruments, or Tool Proficiencies.
      These Proficiencies do not count against any Proficiencies gained by any
      <a href="https://www.jojodnd.com/feats">Feats</a> or from your <a href="https://www.jojodnd.com/passions">Passion</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
      - <b>Armor Class</b> (AC) is calculated as either 10 + Dex + Con, 10 + Dex + Wis,
      or 10 + Wis + Con. You may still use armor from 5e if you wish, but this 'Unarmored Defense' <u>will not stack with it</u>.
      The same calculation applies to <a href="https://ww.jojodnd.com/classes?focus=Stands">Stands</a>, with their respective stats.
  </p>
  <p>
      - <b>Medicine Checks</b> may be performed on a character with <u>0 Hit Points</u>.
      If you succeed the Medicine Check (DC 10), they are not just stabilized, but also return to 1 Hit Point.
  </p>
  <p>
      - <b>Inspiration</b> can be used to reroll something entirely, rather than just granting Advantage. It also has no upper limit in terms of how much you can have and can be given to another character over the course of a Short or Long Rest.
  </p>
  <p>
      - <b>Unarmed Strikes</b> deal 1d4 Bludgeoning Damage.
      You may choose to add either your <u>Strength OR Dexterity</u> to the Attack Rolls, but only Strength may be added to the Damage Rolls.
  </p>
  <p>
      - <b>Light Weapons</b> may be dual-wielded alongside another Light weapon or an empty hand.
      For this purpose Unarmed Strikes are considered to have the Light property.
  </p>
  <p>
      - <b>Speed Duels</b> may be performed when you wish to take an action before your target can react (stealing, disarming, quick draw, etc.).
      To do so, you must use a single Attack and both creatures must roll an Athletics (Wisdom) Check, or an Athletics (Speed) Check if using a Stand.
      If the attacker rolls higher, they successfully carry out the desired action. Otherwise, nothing happens.
  </p>
  <p>
      - <b>Multiclassing</b> is allowed. For example a Stand User with a Power Type Stand might also choose to use The Ripple.
      However, each character can only have one Stand. Typically this means each character can only have one Stand Type, but Multi-Type Stands are allowed. 
      The rules for this are detailed on the <a href="https://www.jojodnd.com/classes">Classes</a> page.

  <h3>Skills</h3>
  <p>To better fit the settings typically seen in the world of JoJo's, some of the Skills in our system are slightly different.</p>
  <ul>
      <li><b>Acrobatics:</b> Uses Dexterity. Used to determine precise movement in the air, balancing abilities, and can be used to contest a grapple/shove.</li>
      <li><b>Athletics:</b> Uses Strength or Wisdom. Strength is used to determine success of athletic activities that require a sudden burst of strength, such as jumping, climbing, swimming, lifting, pushing, or grappling/shoving. Wisdom/Speed is used to determine the result of Speed Duels.</li>
      <li><b>Bluff:</b> Uses Charisma. Used to determine deception, bluffing, or other methods of making people believe or think something other than what is true.</li>
      <li><b>Care:</b> Uses Wisdom or Charisma. Used to determine handling and proper care of animals, children, wounded or elderly people, etc. Wisdom is typically used for dealing with animals, Charisma for people.</li>
      <li><b>Diplomacy:</b> Uses Charisma. Used to influence other people into thinking or understanding things in a certain way.</li>
      <li><b>Finesse:</b> Uses Dexterity. Used to determine careful and precise movements including sleight of hand, pickpocketing, and smaller, more delicate movements.</li>
      <li><b>Grit:</b> Uses Constitution. Used to determine pain tolerance, ability to exert yourself for long periods of time, and ability to handle large amounts of substances.</li>
      <li><b>Intimidate:</b> Uses Strength or Charisma. Used to threaten or coerce other people with the threat of physical force, or something they fear just as much.</li>
      <li><b>Investigation:</b> Uses Intelligence. Used for puzzle solving and finding clues, doesn't help you find something, just helps you know if what you sense is relevant or not.</li>
      <li><b>Medicine:</b> Uses Intelligence or Wisdom. Used to figure out things that require medical knowledge, tend to a wounded creature, and bring a downed ally back to 1 HP.</li>
      <li><b>Knowledge:</b> Uses Intelligence. Used to determine recall of historical information, as well as general information recall.</li>
      <li><b>Perception:</b> Uses Wisdom. Used to find hidden creatures or objects and detect small sensory details.</li>
      <li><b>Presence:</b> Uses Charisma. Used to determine success at blending in or standing out in social settings, as well as seeming like you belong in a place, and a measure of your ability to hold an audience's attention</li>
      <li><b>Science:</b> Uses Intelligence. Used to determine recall of scientific knowledge and understanding, as well as scientific procedure.</li>
      <li><b>Sneak:</b> Uses Dexterity. Used to determine how well someone can move silently and stay hidden.</li>
      <li><b>Supernatural:</b> Uses Intelligence or Wisdom. Intelligence is used for recalling information regarding religious, spiritual, or otherwise supernatural occurrences, events, and rituals. Wisdom is used to determine part of the cause or effect of a supernatural ability when observing it directly or indirectly.</li>
      <li><b>Survival:</b>  Uses Intelligence or Wisdom. Intelligence is used for recalling information about the functions of nature, including determining safe or valuable plants. Wisdom is used to determine tracking, creating a trap, or navigating an unknown region.</li>
      <li><b>Vibe:</b> Uses Wisdom or Charisma. Used to determine if someone may be hiding something, as well as if they have any ulterior motives. Failed checks don't give you false information, they just don't give you any.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The effective conversions from 5e Skills are as follows:</p>
  <ul>
      <li>Animal Handling becomes Care</li>
      <li>Arcana becomes Supernatural</li>
      <li>Deception becomes Bluff</li>
      <li>History becomes Knowledge</li>
      <li>Insight becomes Vibe</li>
      <li>Intimidation becomes Intimidate</li>
      <li>Nature becomes Survival</li>
      <li>Performance becomes Presence</li>
      <li>Persuasion becomes Diplomacy</li>
      <li>Religion becomes Supernatural</li>
      <li>Sleight of Hand becomes Finesse</li>
      <li>Stealth becomes Sneak</li>
  </ul>
</section>
<section>
  <h3>Tools</h3>
  <p>These items may be acquired and gained Proficiency in through various means. Using them may allow you to make various Skill Checks that you otherwise might not be able to perform.</p>
  <p>The list of tools and their various use cases is as follows:</p>
  <ul>

      <li><b>Chemist's Tools</b> may be used to create basic chemical compounds, identify a chemical, store a small amount of a strange substance, or create chemical reactions.</li>
      <li><b>Cook's Utensils</b> may be used to create a variety of meals, dice something finely, identify ingredients in a dish, or experiment to find a new dish.</li>
      <li><b>Diviner's Tools</b> may be used to predict the future, often in ways that don't make sense without context until the moment of truth.</li>
      <li><b>Engineer's Tools</b> may be used to move something heavy, measure a precise amount of distance, or to repair certain structures or machines that have been damaged.</li>
      <li><b>Fletcher's Tools</b> may be used to create and maintain weapons and ammunition made out of wood and natural materials, including bows, crossbows, atlatls, spears, clubs, and darts.</li>
